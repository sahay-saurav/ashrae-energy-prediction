# ashrae-energy-prediction
In this project a model for predicting metered building energy usage in the following areas: chilled water, electric, hot water, and steam meters is developed. For development of model the data comes from over 1,000 buildings, with better estimates of these energy-saving investments, large scale investors and financial institutions will be more inclined to invest in this area to enable progress in building efficiencies.
